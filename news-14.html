    An update on Rhino Linux's development goals and structure
  </h1>
  <p class="text-off-white mt-4">
    After a lot of discussions with the Rhino Linux team, we are finally ready to announce changes to the way we develop. We have decided to focus on the following areas: <br>
    &bull; Providing a strong Contributor's Code of Conduct <br>
    &bull; Outlining our goals as an organisation through our <a href="statement.html" class="text-rhino-purple">Mission Statement</a>. <br/>
    &bull; Focusing effort on strong development and user documentation. <br>
    &bull; Rewriting our website in React, which will provide us with better tools for Documentation. <br>
    &bull; Streamlining development channels. <br>
  </p>
  <p class="text-off-white mt-4">
    With our contributor's code of conduct, we aim to provide a safe and welcoming environment for all contributors. We want to ensure that everyone feels welcome and that their contributions are valued. We believe that this will help us to attract more contributors and improve the quality of our software. Our newly written contributor's code of conduct can be found <a href="coc.html" class="text-rhino-purple" target="_blank">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="text-off-white mt-4">
    Our decision to rewrite our website in React is going to provide us with significantly better tools when it comes to managing our documentation, publishing blog posts and ensuring long-term maintainability. We plan to write development documentation while we undertake this website redesign. This development documentation will be made publicly available to all users and contributors. By documenting our development process, we aim to provide a clear, transparent view to how Rhino Linux is maintained, and help new contributors get up to speed quickly.
  </p>
  <p class="text-off-white mt-4">
    We have outlined our goals as an organisation through our <a href="statement.html" class="text-rhino-purple">Mission Statement</a>. Our mission statement serves as a guide for the Rhino Linux team, and outlines our goals as an organisation as well as allowing you to understand our vision for Rhino Linux, and why we are building it.
  </p>
  <p class="text-off-white mt-4">
    We currently have long-term plans to move development discussions away from Discord and onto a public-facing forum, which should allow for more structured discussions, better organisation of development tasks and a more centralised location for development discussions. Until then, we will continue to utilise Discord as our primary development channel. Updates on the development of this forum will come soon.
  </p>
  <p class="text-off-white mt-4">
    We are excited about these changes, and believe that this will help us to build the foundations for a stronger, more vibrant Rhino Linux community, where any user feels empowered to contribute to the project.
  </p>
  <p class="text-off-white mt-4">
    Many thanks, <br>
    The Rhino Linux Team. 
  </p>
