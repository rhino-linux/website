    2023.1-beta6: New App, PineTab2, and more!
  </h1>
  <p class="text-off-white mt-4">
    This beta release brings a flurry of desktop improvements, bug fixes, and under-the-hood improvements to the distribution, as well as a new platform to run Rhino Linux on! Our biggest changes are:
  </p>
  <h1 class="text-2xl mt-4 text-off-white">
    Your System
  </h1>
  <p class="text-off-white mt-4">
    &bull; The inclusion of our new Your System app, a handy graphical application that allows for you to view system information at a glance. Furthermore, it provides a graphical method for you to update all of your software packages.
  </p>
  <h1 class="text-2xl mt-4 text-off-white">
    PineTab2
  </h1>
  <p class="text-off-white mt-4">
    • Joining Rhino Linux's mobile & Pine64 ecosystem is the newly released PineTab2! Our images comes with the bootloader pre-installed, so you can flash it directly to your preferred storage volume and get going. The port uses kernel 6.3.9-rockchip from the Mobian team, and has auto-rotation, audio, USB networking, and more working out-of-the-box. Combining this with our minimally-patched Unicorn Desktop environment unicorn-mobile-git, Rhino Linux provides a perfect and stable experience for you to get started experimenting with your new Linux tablet. (NOTE: the WiFi driver for the PineTab2 has not been ported yet. See https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PineTab2#How-to for current solutions.)

  </h1>
  <p class="text-off-white mt-4">
    • Pacstall 3.15.0 has released, featuring a vital component that will assist Rhino users: a dependency tree! This assists the upgrade process with ordering, so that your package's dependencies are installed in the correct order. For packages like linux-kernel and linux-kernel-stable this is especially important, so be sure to upgrade to the latest version! See below for how.
  </p>
  <p class="text-off-white mt-4">
    • Unicorn has seen some improvements and changes, such as the disabling of animations on xfdashboard and rearranging our panel. This is now pre-packaged in the latest ISO file and core pacscripts.
  </p>
  <p class="text-off-white mt-4">
    • When you open up Firefox, you will now be greeted with https://rhinolinux.org/landing, which will give you quick-links to our Wiki, News, Contact and RhinoDrop. Users on 2023.1-beta5 and below will not recieve this change, and will need to run this command to recieve the change:
  </p>
  <code class="text-off-white bg-site-200 rounded-[0.65em] p-1 border-rhino-purple border-2">sudo rm -r /etc/firefox/syspref.js</code>. <br><br>
  <code class="text-off-white bg-site-200 rounded-[0.65em] p-1 border-rhino-purple border-2">echo 'pref("browser.startup.homepage", "https://rhinolinux.org/landing/");' | sudo tee -a /etc/firefox/syspref.js</code>.

  <p class="text-off-white mt-4">
    If you are on a previous release, you can update your system to install the rest of the latest changes with:
