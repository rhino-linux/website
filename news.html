                        Moving forward with Rolling Rhino Remix
                    </h1>
                    <p class="mt-4">
                        Over time, the current development model of Rolling Rhino Remix has become untenable. It started as a passion project with code that is not mature. The project grew quickly, and unfortunately the immature code that makes the distribution is still present today. Rhino Linux will be an Ubuntu-based, rolling release operating system with Ubuntu, Pacstall, and XFCE at the core of the distribution.
